A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Binaa team
## Overview


The construction e-commerce “Aqar / Binaa” is a platform for construction shops and companies to show their products, equipment, and tools ..etc. for the customers online. 

The Bahraini market is lacking platform for the construction market. We believe that the platform is a step to move towards digitalizing the sector.
